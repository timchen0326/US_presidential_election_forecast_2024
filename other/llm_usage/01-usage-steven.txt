LLM: ChatGPT-4o

Usage 1 - Simulating and Testing Script Creation
User: For the simulation part of my paper, I need you to help me write an R script that simulates the data. Here are the variables I want you to simulate, which contains only trump and Harris: pollster, pollster_rating, method, state, voter type, party, winner, and percentage. 
Refer to the example simualation script in your content, by following the same structure and guidance, but in the context of pollster data

LLM: Certainly! I'll create an R script to simulate pollster data for the 2024 US presidential election between Trump and Harris, following the structure and guidance of the example you provided. Here's the script:
rCopy#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Simulates pollster data for the 2024 US presidential election (Trump vs Harris)
# Author: [Your Name]
# Date: 18 October 2024
# Contact: [Your Email]

#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

#### Data expectations ####
# Pollster Data:
# - Columns: poll_id, pollster, pollster_rating, method, state, voter_type, party, winner, percentage
# - poll_id should be unique
# - Date should be between 2024-01-01 and 2024-10-18
# - pollster_rating should be between 1 and 5
# - method should be one of: "Online", "Phone", "Mixed"
# - state should be valid US state abbreviations
# - voter_type should be one of: "Likely Voters", "Registered Voters", "All Adults"
# - party should be one of: "Republican", "Democrat"
# - winner should be one of: "Trump", "Harris"
# - percentage should be between 0 and 100

set.seed(2024)

#### Simulate Pollster Data ####
num_polls <- 1000

pollster_data <- tibble(
  poll_id = seq(1, num_polls),
  date = sample(seq(as.Date('2024-01-01'), as.Date('2024-10-18'), by="day"), num_polls, replace=TRUE),
  pollster = sample(c("Gallup", "Rasmussen", "YouGov", "Ipsos", "Quinnipiac"), num_polls, replace=TRUE),
  pollster_rating = round(runif(num_polls, 1, 5), 1),
  method = sample(c("Online", "Phone", "Mixed"), num_polls, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.5, 0.3, 0.2)),
  state = sample(state.abb, num_polls, replace=TRUE),
  voter_type = sample(c("Likely Voters", "Registered Voters", "All Adults"), num_polls, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.6, 0.3, 0.1)),
  party = sample(c("Republican", "Democrat"), num_polls, replace=TRUE),
  winner = sample(c("Trump", "Harris"), num_polls, replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.52, 0.48)),
  percentage = round(runif(num_polls, 40, 60), 1)
)

# Adjust percentages based on winner
pollster_data <- pollster_data %>%
  mutate(percentage = case_when(
    winner == "Trump" ~ percentage,
    winner == "Harris" ~ 100 - percentage
  ))

#### Visualizations ####
# Poll results over time
pollster_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = percentage, color = winner)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Poll Results Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Percentage",
       color = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal()

# Distribution of poll methods
pollster_data %>%
  count(method) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = method, y = n, fill = method)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Poll Methods",
       x = "Method",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Average poll results by state
pollster_data %>%
  group_by(state, winner) %>%
  summarise(avg_percentage = mean(percentage)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(state, avg_percentage), y = avg_percentage, fill = winner)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Average Poll Results by State",
       x = "State",
       y = "Average Percentage",
       fill = "Candidate") +
  theme_minimal()

# Save the simulated data
write_csv(pollster_data, "simulated_pollster_data.csv")
This script simulates pollster data for the 2024 US presidential election between Trump and Harris. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

It sets up the workspace and loads necessary libraries.
It defines the data expectations, including the structure and constraints of the simulated data.
It simulates 1000 polls with various attributes such as pollster, rating, method, state, voter type, party, winner, and percentage.
It adjusts the percentages to ensure they make sense based on the winner.
It creates three visualizations:

Poll results over time
Distribution of poll methods
Average poll results by state


Finally, it saves the simulated data to a CSV file.

You can run this script to generate a dataset of simulated pollster data for your paper. Remember to adjust the author name, date, and contact information in the preamble to match your details.

User: Now, can you write a set of tests using libary testthat, to write a set of tests for this simulated data

LLM: Certainly! I'll create a test script for the simulated pollster data based on the examples you've provided. Here's a script that tests various aspects of the simulated data:

User: Can you improve my data simulation script to fulfill the Simulation component of the rubric, and adhering to the paper instructions?

LLM: I'll help improve the simulation script to better fulfill the rubric requirements and paper instructions. The simulation should be sophisticated, clearly commented, and reflect realistic polling scenarios based on the provided context documents.

Usage 2 - Improving script for testing actual data
User: I want you to improve my testing script on my actual data. Below is my current script, I want you to improve it using information you have on the variables from "Full Dataset Variables" in your project knowledge. Ensuring you adhere to paper instructions, and making sure the testing code gets full marks on the 'Tests-actual' component of the Rubric.

Usage 3 - Formatting tables and figures
User: I have a table with a few issues:
set.seed(778) # For reproducability

data_overview <- data %>%
  select(pollster, pollscore, numeric_grade, transparency_score, sample_size, 
         methodology, pct, state, candidate_name, end_date)

# Transpose the first 5 rows to display them vertically
data_overview <- data_overview %>%
  sample_n(5) %>%
  t()

# Display the transposed table
kable(data_overview)
How can I reduce the font size, since it's rotated, the values are overlapping. 

LLM: To reduce the font size of your transposed table when displaying with kable, you can use the kableExtra package, which offers enhanced control over kable outputs. This package allows you to style tables, including font size adjustments.

Here's how you can modify your code to reduce the font size:

Ensure you have the kableExtra package installed:
R
Copy code
install.packages("kableExtra")
Adjust your code to include kable_styling() for font size control:
r
Copy code
library(kableExtra)

set.seed(778) # For reproducibility

data_overview <- data %>%
  select(pollster, pollscore, numeric_grade, transparency_score, sample_size, 
         methodology, pct, state, candidate_name, end_date)

# Transpose the first 5 rows to display them vertically
data_overview <- data_overview %>%
  sample_n(5) %>%
  t()

# Display the transposed table with reduced font size
kable(data_overview) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
You can adjust the font_size parameter as needed to prevent overlapping. The smaller the value, the smaller the font.

User: how can I make the values wrap if its extremely long

LLM: To make the values in a table wrap when they are too long, you can use the kableExtra package with the column_spec() function to set a specific width for the columns. This ensures that text wraps within the cell when it exceeds the specified width.

Here's how you can modify your code:

Ensure the kableExtra package is loaded.
Use column_spec() to set the width of the columns, which forces text to wrap.
Here's the updated code:

r
Copy code
library(kableExtra)

set.seed(778) # For reproducibility

data_overview <- data %>%
  select(pollster, pollscore, numeric_grade, transparency_score, sample_size, 
         methodology, pct, state, candidate_name, end_date)

# Transpose the first 5 rows to display them vertically
data_overview <- data_overview %>%
  sample_n(5) %>%
  t()

# Display the transposed table with text wrapping and reduced font size
kable(data_overview) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10) %>%
  column_spec(1:ncol(data_overview), width = "5cm")
Explanation:
column_spec(1:ncol(data_overview), width = "5cm"): This sets the width of all columns to 5 cm, causing the text to wrap when it exceeds this width. Adjust the width as necessary to fit your needs.
kable_styling(font_size = 10): Reduces the font size to ensure more space.
Feel free to adjust the width and font size to get the desired appearance for your table.

LLM: Appendix: Survey Methodology for Forecasting the US Presidential Election

Introduction
This survey methodology presents a comprehensive plan for forecasting the US presidential election within a $100,000 budget. Designed to be statistically sound and practical, it aims to accurately predict election outcomes by considering both the popular vote and electoral college implications.

1. Sampling Strategy
The target population comprises eligible voters across the United States who are likely to participate in the upcoming presidential election. Utilizing a stratified random sampling method ensures representation across key demographics such as age, gender, race, education level, and geographic location. By drawing from registered voter lists and demographic data from reputable sources like the US Census Bureau, we aim for a sample size of approximately 10,000 respondents. This size achieves a margin of error of ±1% at a 95% confidence level. Geographical distribution is proportionally allocated across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with oversampling in swing states to better predict electoral college outcomes. Weighting adjustments address any underrepresented groups to ensure the sample mirrors the overall voter population.

2. Recruitment Plan
To recruit respondents effectively, we will leverage online panels, social media advertising, and partnerships with community organizations to reach a diverse audience. Offering modest incentives, such as $5 digital gift cards, encourages participation while managing costs. Quota sampling within strata maintains demographic balance, and follow-up reminders along with mobile-friendly survey formats help reduce non-response bias. The data collection will occur over a two-week period to capture timely opinions without introducing temporal biases.

3. Survey Design Elements
The survey is crafted to elicit accurate and meaningful responses. It employs a mix of closed-ended questions, Likert scales, and multiple-choice options for clarity and ease of analysis. Response options include balanced and neutral choices, with options for "Undecided" or "Prefer not to say." The question order begins with general inquiries to build rapport, followed by specific vote intention questions, and concludes with demographic queries. We collect information on age, gender, race, education, income, geographic location, political affiliation, past voting behavior, and political engagement. Likely voter screens gauge voting likelihood through questions about past voting frequency and current intention to vote. Confidential and anonymous vote intention questions directly ask which candidate the respondent intends to support.

4. Quality Control
To maintain data integrity, we implement several quality control measures. Real-time validation checks within the survey prevent inconsistent or illogical responses. Attention-check questions identify disengaged respondents. We use unique survey links and track IP addresses to prevent duplicate submissions, while CAPTCHA verification deters automated responses. Incomplete or suspicious responses are excluded during data cleaning to ensure the final dataset is robust and reliable.

5. Data Processing
Accurate analysis is ensured through careful data processing. Survey results are adjusted using weighting factors based on demographic proportions in the voting population. Missing data is handled by employing imputation techniques or excluding cases with significant gaps. Outliers that may skew results are identified and reviewed to determine whether to retain or discard them. Responses are cross-checked for consistency and plausibility. Additionally, we will combine our survey data with other reputable polls using meta-analytic techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

6. Budget Allocation
The $100,000 budget is allocated to ensure all aspects are adequately funded:

Recruitment Costs: $40,000 for advertising and partnerships.
Incentive Payments: $50,000 for participant incentives ($5 x 10,000 respondents).
Survey Platform Fees: $2,000 for premium features on a platform like Google Forms.
Data Analysis Tools: $3,000 for statistical software licenses.
Quality Control Measures: $3,000 for validation systems and CAPTCHA services.
Administrative Costs: $2,000 for project management expenses.
7. Implementation Requirements
Execution involves selecting Google Forms for its accessibility and robust features, ensuring data security and ease of use. The technical setup includes customizing the survey with professional branding and configuring settings for optimal data collection. Data collection is scheduled over two weeks, with monitoring of response rates and adjustments as needed. Quality assurance procedures involve regular reviews of incoming data to address any issues promptly. Data is stored securely with encryption, complying with privacy regulations to protect respondent information.

Practical Implementation Steps
Survey Creation: Develop a comprehensive survey on Google Forms, including a professional introduction, clear contact information, structured questions covering demographics, political behavior, and vote intentions, and a closing thank-you message.
Methodology Documentation: Include in the appendix a detailed explanation of the sampling approach, recruitment strategies, quality control procedures, data processing methods, budget allocation, and a realistic timeline for implementation.
Survey Accessibility: Provide an active link to the survey and include a full copy of the survey questions in the appendix. Offer justifications for methodological decisions, along with a discussion of potential limitations and mitigation strategies.
Conclusion
This methodology offers a feasible and thorough plan to forecast the US presidential election within the specified budget. By adhering to best practices in survey design and execution, and considering both the popular vote and electoral college implications, the survey aims to provide accurate and reliable insights into voter intentions.
